# tx.activation

**Activation functions** are mainly used with the [Activation](/api/layers/Activation/) layer, but these need not
be `TensorX` functions only. Any function from
`Tensorflow` or any generic function that takes tensors as inputs and outputs a `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` objects, can
be used. This namespace is included for convenience and future extra activation functions.
