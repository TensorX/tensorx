**Initializers** allow you to pre-specify an initialization strategy, encoded in
a `Callable` object, without knowing the `shape` and `dtype` of the `Variable`
being initialized.

!!! info
    Despite most initializers being accessible through **Tensorflow**, we decided to gather
    them here for the sake of **namespace** consistency (not all TF initializers are in tf.initializers)
