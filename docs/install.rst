Installation
############

TensorX only depends on `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ and `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_. In any case
this library can be installed using `pip` with the `setup.py` declaring all the dependencies and version requirements.

Requirements
============

    * **python**: `tensorx` supports python version **3.5+**.
    * **pip**: python includes _pip_ for installing additional modules that are not shipped with your operating system.
    * **virtualenv**: `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ is recommended to install `tensorx` in its
        own environment to avoid interfering with system-wide packages.

Pip Installation
================

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install tensorflow # or tensorflow-gpu
    pip install tensorx
