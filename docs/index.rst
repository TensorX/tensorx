.. TensorX documentation master file, created by
    sphinx-quickstart on Thu Aug 24 23:56:40 2017.
    You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
    contain the root `toctree` directive.

TensorX is a minimalistic high-level library to build and train neural network
models in `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_. It was developed to
design simple neural network models with minimum verbose.

Features
========

* **Neural Network** layer building blocks
* **TensorFlow ops**  for tensor manipulation
* **Model class** for easy inference, training, and evaluation
* **Customizable training loop** with ``Callback`` system
* **Complements** TensorFlow


Development
===========
Both this library and its documentation are a work in progress, any input is
welcome. You can follow the project on `Github
<https://github.com/davidenunes/tensorx>`_ and read its documentation on
`readthedocs <http://tensorx.readthedocs.io>`_. I'm focusing on features I myself
use in my research, so I'll add components as I need them.
