   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

TensorX is a lightweight minimalistic library to build and train neural network models in
`TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_.




Disclaimer
==========
Both this library and its documentation are a work in progress. The focus for now is on features I myself use in my
research. My focus at the moment is on language modelling, auto-encoders, and generative models in general. As such,
I might not include features for certain types of neural network architectures just yet (such as CNN networks).
